Latency
  The time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it

Bandwidth
  Maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path



Propagation delay
  Amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to receiver, which is a
  function of distance over speed with which the signal propagates.

Transmission delay
  Amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the link, which is a function of the
  packet's length and data rate of the link.

Processing delay
  Amount of time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors, and determine
  the packet's destination.

Queuing delay
  Amount of time the incoming packet is waiting in the queue until it can be processed.


Each packet traveling over the network will incur many instances of each of these delays. The
farther the distance between the source and destination, the more time it will take to propagate.
The more intermediate routers we encounter along the way, the higher the processing and
transmission delays for each packet. Finally, the higher the load of traffic along the path, the
higher the likelihood of our packet being delayed inside an incoming buffer.


As a result, to improve performance of our applications, we need to architect and optimize our
protocols and networking code with explicit awareness of the limitations of available bandwidth
and the speed of light: we need to reduce round trips, move the data closer to the client, and
build applications that can hide the latency through caching, pre-fetching, and a variety of
similar techniques, as explained in subsequent chapters.
