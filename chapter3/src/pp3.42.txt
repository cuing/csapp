suppose it was compiled on a Windows machine, where each primitive data type of
K bytes must have an offset that is a multiple of K.
A. What are the byte offsets of all the fields in the structure?
4 + 4(2) + 8 + 4(1) + 4 + 8(1) + 8 + 8(4) = ;

B. What is the total size of the structure?

The end of the structure must be padded by 4 bytes to satisfy the 8-byte 
alignment requirement.

C. Rearrange the fields of the structure to minimize wasted space, and then show
the byte offsets and total size for the rearranged structure.

long long
double
float
void
char *
short
char
char

8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 32;
