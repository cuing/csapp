4.1 The Y86 Instruction Set Architecture

One important property of any instruction set is that the byte encodings must have a unique
interpretation.

Aside  Comparing IA32 to Y86 instruction encodings
  We use a 4-bit encoding of registers, even though there are only eight possible registers.
  IA32 uses just 3 bits. Thus IA32 can pack a push or pop instruction into just 1 byte, with
  a 5-bit field indicating the instruction and the remaining 3 bits for the register specifier.
  IA32 can encode constant values in 1, 2 or 4 bytes, whereas Y86 always requires 4 byte.


The Y86 instruction set includes attributes of both CISC and RISC instruction sets. one the CISC
side, it has condition codes, variable-length instructions, and stack-intensive procedure
linkages. On the RISC side, it uses load-store architecture and a regualr encoding. It can be
viewed as taking a CISC instrction set and simplifying it by applying some of the principles
of RISC.

4.2 Logic Design and the Hardware Control Language HCL

In current technology, logic value 1 is represented by a high voltage of around 1.0 volt, while
logic value 0 is represented by a low voltage of around 0.0 volts. Three major components are
required to implement a digital system: combinational logic to compute functions on the bits,
memory elements to store bits, and clock signals to regulate the updating of the memory element.
